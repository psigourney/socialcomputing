1) Show a perfect matching exists between set A and set B where each node in A is connected to at least d nodes in B (where d >= 1) and each node in B is connected to at most d nodes in A.

Each node in A is connected to at least d nodes in B, therefore there are >= (n * d) incoming edges from A to B.  Because each node in B can have at most d incoming edges: (total incoming edges / max edges per B node) == (n * d) / (d) == at least n nodes in B will receive an edge from an element in A. And since n = |A| = |B|, there is a perfect matching from A to B.

Base case: n = |A| = |B| = 1;  d = 1
Each node in A has at least 1 outgoing edge, each node in B has at most 1 incoming edge.
|A| = 1 => ( |E| >= 1 )
|B| = 1 => ( |E| <= 1 )
Therefore |E| == 1;
(n=1 ^ |E|=1) => |M| = 1 and perfect matching.

Induction case 1: n = 2; d = 1
Each node in A has at least 1 outgoing edge (|E| = 1n = 2).
Each node in B can have at most 1 incoming edge, there are a total of 2 edges and B contains 2 nodes, therefore each node in B has 1 incoming edge .  |M|=2 == n therefore we have perfect matching.

Induction case 2: n = 2; d = 2
Each node in A has at least 2 outgoing edges (|E| = 2n = 4). 
Each node in B can have at most 2 incoming edges, there are a total of 4 edges and B contains 2 nodes, therefore each node in B has 2 incoming edges


2) Show that Konig-Egarvary Theorem implies Hall's Theorem.

Konig-Egarvary: For any bipartite graph, max matching size == min vertex cover (duality!)
Vertex cover is a subset of nodes where every node in the graph is adjacent to at least one node in the subset/cover.

Hall's Theorem:  Perfect matching is possible iff there is no constricted set, ie: |s| <= |N(s)|
(more recipients than senders... implying that every sender will have a recipient and we have perfect matching)


3) Show that any r x n Soduku can be extended to (r+1) x n whenever r < n.
