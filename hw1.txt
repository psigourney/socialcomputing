1) Show a perfect matching exists between set A and set B where each node in A is connected to at least d nodes in B (where d >= 1) and each node in B is connected to at most d nodes in A.

Each node in A is connected to at least d nodes in B, therefore there are >= (n * d) incoming edges from A to B.  Because each node in B can have at most d incoming edges: 
(total incoming edges / max edges per B node) == (n * d) / (d) == at least n nodes in B will receive an edge from an element in A. And since n = |A| = |B|, there is a perfect matching from A to B.

2) Show that Konig-Egarvary Theorem implies Hall's Theorem.

Konig-Egarvary: For any bipartite graph, max matching size == min vertex cover (duality!)
Vertex cover is a subset of nodes where every node in the graph is adjacent to at least one node in the subset/cover.

Hall's Theorem:  Perfect matching is possible iff there is no constricted set, ie: |s| <= |N(s)|
(more recipients than senders... implying that every sender will have a recipient and we have perfect matching)


3) Show that any r x n Soduku can be extended to (r+1) x n whenever r < n.
