1) Show a perfect matching exists between set A and set B where each node in A is connected to at least d nodes in B (where d >= 1) and each node in B is connected to at most d nodes in A.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Each element of A has at least d edges; there are at least (n*d) outgoing edges from set A to set B.
Each element of B has at most d edges; there are at most (n*d) inbound edges to set B from set A.
This implies there are EXACTLY (n*d) edges between set A and set B.
Because there are (n*d) inbound edges to B, and each node in B can have a maximum of d edges, this ensures that all n elements of B will have at least one inbound edge from a node in A:  nd inbound edges / max of d edges per node = n nodes with at least 1 edge.
Therefore, iff |B| >= |A|, there will always be perfect matching.
=======
Each node in A is connected to at least d nodes in B, therefore there are >= (n * d) incoming edges from A to B.  Because each node in B can have at most d incoming edges: (total incoming edges / max edges per B node) == (n * d) / (d) == at least n nodes in B will receive an edge from an element in A. And since n = |A| = |B|, there is a perfect matching from A to B.

Base case: n = |A| = |B| = 1;  d = 1
Each node in A has at least 1 outgoing edge, each node in B has at most 1 incoming edge.
|A| = 1 => ( |E| >= 1 )
|B| = 1 => ( |E| <= 1 )
Therefore |E| == 1;
(n=1 ^ |E|=1) => |M| = 1 and perfect matching.

Induction case 1: n = 2; d = 1
Each node in A has at least 1 outgoing edge (|E| = 1n = 2).
Each node in B can have at most 1 incoming edge, there are a total of 2 edges and B contains 2 nodes, therefore each node in B has 1 incoming edge .  |M|=2 == n therefore we have perfect matching.

Induction case 2: n = 2; d = 2
Each node in A has at least 2 outgoing edges (|E| = 2n = 4). 
Each node in B can have at most 2 incoming edges, there are a total of 4 edges and B contains 2 nodes, therefore each node in B has 2 incoming edges

2) Show that Konig-Egarvary Theorem implies Hall's Theorem. (TODO)

Konig-Egarvary: For any bipartite graph, max matching size == min vertex cover (duality!)
Vertex cover is a subset of nodes where every node in the graph is adjacent to at least one node in the subset/cover.

Hall's Theorem:  Perfect matching is possible iff there is no constricted set, ie: |s| <= |N(s)|
(more recipients than senders... implying that every sender will have a recipient and we have perfect matching)


3) Show that any r x n Soduku can be extended to (r+1) x n whenever r < n.

n digits can be placed in n unique combinations where each digit in each combination only appears in a specific location once.

3 digits (3x3):
1 2 3
2 3 1
3 1 2

4 digits (4x4):
1 2 3 4
2 3 4 1
3 4 1 2
4 1 2 3

Therefore given a Soduku with r < n, additional unique combinations of the n digits can be added until n rows are completed.

5 digits (5x4) where r < n:
1 2 3 4 5
2 3 4 5 1
3 4 5 1 2
4 5 1 2 3

Becomes (5x5):
1 2 3 4 5
2 3 4 5 1
3 4 5 1 2
4 5 1 2 3
5 1 2 3 4
